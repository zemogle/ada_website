Now is your chance to buy a pack of comics for your school, homeschool group or club!

<script type="text/javascript" src="/js/shopify_en.js"></script>

With every classroom pack bought we will donate a pack of 30 comics to a school in a disadvantaged part of the World. The schools we donate to are selected by our international education partners [Universe Awareness](http://unawe.org), [IAU Office of Astronomy for Development](http://www.astro4dev.org) and [Astronomers without Borders](http://astronomerswithoutborders.org).
