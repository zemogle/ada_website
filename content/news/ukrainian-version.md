To celebrate publishing a Ukrainian version of Ada's Adventures in Science we are offering a free copy of Ada's Adventures in Science to anyone (in UK) who donates more than Â£2. We are using Collection Pot to collect this money and will donate everything collected to the charity [Voices of Children](https://voices.org.ua/en/) which helps children who have experienced trauma.

Ada's Adventures main message is one of hope. That by giving children confidence they can explore the world around them free from prejudice.
