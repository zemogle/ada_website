We have just taken delivery of 15,000 copies of Ada's Adventures in Science. That breaks down as 200 German copies, 800 Welsh copies, 3000 Spanish copies, and 11,000 English copies. They are filling a corner of Edward's shared office in Cardiff University.

The 200 German copies and 200 of the Welsh copies are exclusively for our 2 wonderful language backers. Out of the rest 900 will be sent out to schools backers have chosen (the custom classroom packs) and the rest will be distributed through our fantastic education partners around the globe.

Very soon all our backers will recieve their individual copies of the comic book, as well as a very special bonus...stickers!
